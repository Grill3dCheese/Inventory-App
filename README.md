# Inventory-App

An all-in-one inventory app created to assist my mother in a personal business venture!

# What's Needed?
Recently my mother started her own business that required her to obtain several pieces of inventory. She needed a way to keep track of all of her given inventory in that moment, down to the exact # of items currently in stock. She figured an excel sheet would be the easiest way to do this but, after use, she found excel's UI/UX to be overly complicated.

# An Opportunity Arises!
Ahhh yes! So I found this as an exciting opportunity to create a web application that she could use on any of her current devices. I also felt this would be the best route to take as I could create an entirely custom UI/UX to her liking. So, using the skills I currently have - I went to work to create such an app. 

# Well, what's next?
Currently the app is in development. While I have come out with a "stable V1.0" I still have plently to add. Currently the app has the ability to register a new user, login/authenticate, create new inventory to the DB, allows the user to edit & delete the item, filter for specific categories and a few smaller things. 

However, I'm currently working on:

- ðŸ”Ž Search functionality! - Adding in the ability to search by given inventory tags.
	- Would also like to be able to search for 

Disclaimer: This app is extremely specific to the business it is intended for. This is not a one size fits all type of inventory app.
